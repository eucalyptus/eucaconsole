    <p> Eucalyptus offers persistent storage that you can attach to a
        running instance. These elastic block storage (EBS) volumes persist
        autonomously from the running life of an instance. After you attach a
        block volume to an instance, you can use it like any other physical hard
        drive.
    </p>
    <p>Add the details of your new volume:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Type the name of your volume in the <strong>Name</strong> textbox.</li>
        <li>If you would like to create a volume from an existing snapshot, select the snapshot from the
            <strong>Create from snapshot?</strong> drop-down listbox.
        </li>
        <li>Enter the size of the volume in gigabytes in the <strong>Volume Size (GB)</strong> text box.
            <p><strong>Note:</strong>
                If you're creating a volume from a snapshot, you
                can't enter a volume size that's smaller than the
                original snapshot you've selected.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Select an availability zone from the <strong>Availability Zone</strong> drop-down list box.
            <p><strong>Note:</strong>
                You can only attach a volume to an instance in the same availability zone.
            </p>
